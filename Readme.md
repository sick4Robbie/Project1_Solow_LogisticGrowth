This Project investigates the basic Solow Model with logistic population growth instead of exponential growth.

Solow_exponentialVSlogistic.R contains the main model, comparing exponential with logistic growth and simulating various time series.
Solow_exponential_goldenRule.R plots (steady state) per capita consumption given any savings rate, depicting the optimal savings rate given parameter calibrations.

app.R is unfinished.
